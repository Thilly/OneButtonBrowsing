About:
  My goal is to create an interface for the internet that can be controlled with a single button.

  The mouse is controlled by a sweep along the different axis. The input will freeze the sweep locking in a value for that axis.
  When both coordinates are locked in, the interface will look like a crosshair, hopefully centered over the users intended target.
  This will prompt a click event to be executed at that viewport location.

  I'm still thinking of ways to be able to change how the click will function (right/left/middle/double/long) while still preserving the accessible nature.

  I also plan to add buttons to the extremes of the viewport for browser actions like back or forward.
  Additionally, I would like to add an onscreen keyboard with predictive typing.
