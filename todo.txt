  get thilly.net doing something, explanation/practice?

go back over documentation befre gets too big to remember
also figure out a naming convention...
  hard to keep what's what, and which js is accessible where.

feature dump::
generalize the content_script embedding and messaging
  add buttons (togglable, movable, re-sizeable)
    back
    forward
    stop
    favorites?
    keyboard
    url

  make speed slow down at extremes (1+ sec over buttons)
  make popup.html the menu
  save settings to local storage
  keep as embedded or go back to extension/thing?
    clean up the embedded/extension refactor regardless
  name it, CrossHair? oneButton? theButton?
  reverse sweep on hold? double tap?
